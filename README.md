# ActProject


In order to run the project you need to put a valid url at the `baseUrl` variable in the environment file. 

You can either create a fresh firebase "Realtime Database" using your account, or use the test url provided at **Solon portal**. In case you don't have access to Solon, please contact me to provide you a database test url.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.1.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
